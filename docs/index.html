                  This “crazy” who you’re talking about is a genius. A real genius. &nbsp; Dave and Kim piece together that the fancy human meatballs are being used to deter the bears from eating people. They take a team to go tranquilize a bear and bring it back to the lab. In their TRUCK, obviously because that’s just what you do when you want to get a bear from point A to point B, you just put it in the backseat of your car.

                  Washing a dish takes 10 seconds. Putting a dish in the dishwasher takes 7 seconds. 3 seconds is nothing. You can keep standing straight up to wash dishes in the sink. You have to bend over to put something in the dishwasher. Dishes in the dish drying rack are always clean, so you can get into a habit of putting a dish or two away whenever you are waiting for something on the stove.

                  The bear was his only friend now. Plot Summary Chapter 12 opens with Norm Cotten’s suggestion that Jack take some time off to be with his wife. This makes Jack furious, naturally. While Jack is away on unspecified business, Starlight breaks into the house and kills Dorothy.  Jack approves. A bear’s gotta do what a bear’s gotta do. Jack cries, but “not the tears of grief, but of the same old hatred and rage.

Two boys are attacked and the parents of the boys sue the province for gross negligence. The Northern Examinerreleases another on-point headline: “Grossed out at Gros Morne national park bear lunch.”  A town meeting is held with everyone being angry at the park and government officials.

                  The bear is dirty. The bear is why you can’t keep clean. Plot Summary While analysing some of the bear scat that they had retrieved, Dave and his lab friends find human flesh in some of the samples. This is puzzling however, since the samples did notcome from locations where people have been reported missing. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Dave suggests placing a bounty on bears for hunters, and the government was quick to approve this.

                  Theirs was a friendship forged from the intensity of a daring and dangerous encounter Chapter 7 introduces us to our new hero, Dave Bishop, Ph.D, who works for the National Parks and Wildlife Department. We get to know Dave pretty well this chapter, as we hear all about his “trim, youthful physique and professorial manner,” “rugged disposition” and how “his face reflected an intense mental alertness and a focused gaze. He was all business, ready, decisive; there wasn’t much about him that went unnoticed.

Jack hires a lawyer and has his day in court, but ultimately, the judge rules against him, stripping him of his outfitters license.

                  Plot Summary Chapter 1 opens with a picturesque description of the Crandall residence. We meet our hero Jack, his wife Dorothy, and their son Calvin, who currently works at a funeral home, in addition to helping out with his father’s outfitting business. The wealthy Americans arrive, and after one day of hunting, all but one of the hunters has killed a bear. Rick, the leader of the American group, is completely soured by not having bagged a bear.

                  The plot thickens before we even begin the story itself. The very first page of the book, a review by Ed Asner, actor, hints at the dark secrets within.  “What a provocative idea! I found the novel fascinating … an intriguing story. It bears (no pun intended) not only further reading, but further investigation.

                  &nbsp; Have you ever read a book with plot turns so swift and surprising that you needed to put the book down multiple times to catch your breath? That was our experience just reading the back cover of Gros Morne Justice: A Bear Romantic Comedy Buddy Cop Political Intrigue Survival Thriller. Take a look:   &nbsp; We found this gem at a yard sale on our way back from a camping trip on the Fundy coast of New Brunswick.
