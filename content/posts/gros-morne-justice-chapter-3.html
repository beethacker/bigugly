<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plot Sumarry</span>

Chapter 3 basically deals with the court case against Jack, who is being held liable for Rick’s illegal killing of the bear cub. Jack hires a lawyer and has his day in court, but ultimately, the judge rules against him, stripping him of his outfitters license.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assorted thoughts</span>
<ul>
	<li>This chapter doesn’t have anything too crazy in it--it’s just there to move the plot along to where Jack is no longer an outfitter.</li>
	<li><i>However, </i>we do get this progressive gem: <i>She must know her stuff, </i>Jack thought, <i>and she might be just the ticket for the prosecutors in Corner Brook</i>. “I don’t have any problem with a woman as my attorney,” he said aloud. (To no one in particular.) Thanks for clearing that up, Jack!</li>

<ul>
	<li>Nothing notable happened in this chapter that wasn’t outlined in the back cover summary, so all our current plot predictions will stay in place.</li>
