<p>The plot thickens before we even begin the story itself. The very first page of the book, a review by Ed Asner, actor, hints at the dark secrets within.

<p>“What a provocative idea! I found the novel fascinating … an intriguing story. It bears (no pun intended) not only further reading, but further investigation. A cautionary note: Don’t have anyone read this book to President George Bush and Homeland Security. It might give them terrible ideas.”

<p>What terrible ideas could this book have given to the former US president?
</p>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Bears are sentient, and vengeful. This might lead Homeland Security to eradicate bears as a potential threat to humanity.</li>
	<li>Bears are terrorists. Canada is harbouring bear terrorists. This book could ignite a war between two long-standing allies.</li>
	<li>Bears have secret agents among humans. This might start a witch hunt of sorts as Homeland security tries to root out the “bear next door”</li>
	<li>Newfoundland is a great place for sport hunting and GWB should visit</li>
</ul>
<p></ul>

<p>It seems that this book contains a provocative idea which <i>bears</i> further investigation, but should not fall into the wrong hands. What knowledge could this book bestow upon its readers? And who are we to seek it?</p>
